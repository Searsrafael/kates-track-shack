          <h3>About Our Tapes</h3>
          <p>
            The tapes that we put on the list, unless otherwise stated, are
            tested to make sure that they play, but have not been tuned-up (new
            pads/splices).
            <strong

            For those that like to do their own repairs, we also sell the repair
            supplies needed to do that. When you place your order for tapes, if
            you want the tapes tuned-up before they ship, please let us know.

              >We require delivery confirmation on all US packages.</strong
            >
            Most International packages usually have some sort of tracking

          <p>
            <strong>Insurance is optional but highly recommended</strong> on

            be responsible for packages that are lost, stolen or damaged in
            shipping unless the package is insured.

            can also send you an invoice that you can pay using your credit card
            online.

            <strong>Each order must be paid for separately!</strong> Also, if
            you place an order for tapes and then decide you don't want them,
            please let us know so we can put them back on the list.

        <h2><span class="new-badge">NEW!</span> Online Garage Sale</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Who doesn't love a good garage sale!</strong> We had hoped to
          have a "real" garage sale this past year, but things just didn't work
          out so we decided to add an "online" garage sale. We'll be adding
          things all the time so be sure to check back frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Items sold as-is:</strong> We may put up a few pics, but we
          won't be putting up tons of pics. We won't be testing them so they may
          or may not work. Most of the tapes won't have been tested either.
          There may be some that have broken splices, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Grab bags available again!</strong> Whatever genre you choose
          from the list offered on the garage sale page. They may or may not be
          tuned up, but assume that they won't be. Any of the tapes that haven't
          been tuned up can be before they ship for an additional charge.
